# Cpu-Scheduler
This project is for Operating System Course. it was written based on Windows Forms in Visual Studio with C#.
## Aim
implement a static and dynamic scheduler that supports 
1. FCFS
2. SJF (Preemptive and Non Preemptive)
3. Priority (Preemptive and Non Preemptive) (the smaller the priority number the higher the priority)
4. Round Robin.
## Procedure Details
-  A live scheduler is run with each 1 unit of time mapped to 1 second
- Remaining burst time table is updated as time progresses.
- An option to run the currently existing processes only without live scheduling must be available.
## Output
- Timeline showing the order and time taken by each process (Gantt Chart) drawn
live.
- Average waiting time and average turnaround time
- Remaining burst time updated table live
